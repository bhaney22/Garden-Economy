	abstract = {Gintis (2007, 'The Dynamics of General Equilibrium', Economic Journal 117 [523], 1280-1309) provides an agent-based model of a Walrasian economy where the tatonnement is replaced by imitation. His simulations show that the economy converges to the Walrasian equilibrium. Gintis concludes that 1) his stability results provide some justification for the importance placed upon the Walrasian model, and 2) models allowing agents to imitate successful others lead to an economy with a reasonable level of stability and efficiency. Since these conclusions appear to be intended as general, we caution that Gintis's findings can only be accepted for Walrasian models without capital goods in models with capital goods imitation-based adjustments alter the equilibrium's data (which makes the demonstration of stability impossible) and raise other important problems (absent from Gintis's simulations) still awaiting exploration.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models have become one of the main workhorses of macroeconomic analysis. Their impact has been particularly strong within the central banking community, where policy analysis, policy simulation as well as forecasting are based on this class of models. More recently, these models have received a fair amount of criticism both from within and from outside the academic community. In this debate, agent-based models have frequently been discussed as potential competitors to DSGE models for modeling the macroeconomy. Like DSGE models, agent-based models describe economic behavior at the individual level; unlike DSGE models, agent-based models use the simulation capacity of modern computing technology to analyze the aggregate implications of individual behavior, enabling the analysis of a wide range of behavior, the description of fairly complex institutions as well as the study of system dynamics both out of and in equilibrium. In a research workshop held at OeNB on June 15 and 16, 2011, these competing modeling strategies were contrasted with each other to contribute to the discussion about the relative merits and problems of both approaches.},

	abstract = {The use of equilibrium models in economics springs from the desire for parsimonious models of economic phenomena that take human reasoning into account. This approach has been the cornerstone of modern economic theory. We explain why this is so, extolling the virtues of equilibrium theory; then we present a critique and describe why this approach is inherently limited, and why economics needs to move in new directions if it is to continue to make progress. We stress that this shouldn't be a question of dogma, but should be resolved empirically. There are situations where equilibrium models provide useful predictions and there are situations where they can never provide useful predictions. There are also many situations where the jury is still out, i.e., where so far they fail to provide a good description of the world, but where proper extensions might change this. Our goal is to convince the skeptics that equilibrium models can be useful, but also to make traditional economists more aware of the limitations of equilibrium models. We sketch some alternative approaches and discuss why they should play an important role in future research in economics.},

Computer simulation shows that it is possible for agents to act almost as if they had the additional necessary information to define and solve a standard optimization problem. Their behaviour gives rise endogenously to phenomena resembling Adam Smith's invisible hand. The results also indicate that agents must engage in some form of price comparison for decentralized markets to clear--otherwise there is no incentive for firms to respond to excess supply by lowering prices. This suggests that agent-based models with decentralized interaction risk untenable results if price-response decisions are made without being first directed toward the most favourable local price.},

	title = {Essays on {Dynamic} {Economies} with {Uncertainty}},
	url = {http://search.proquest.com/econlit/docview/56199553/A3DAC1C83DB4414EPQ/13?accountid=9844},
	abstract = {In the first three essays I examine the problem of economic survival in the context of general equilibrium models of dynamic economies with uncertainty. In the first essay, I start with a static model of a pure exchange Walrasian economy with uncertainty in the endowments of the agents. The event of the ruin of an agent i is defined as the set of all states of environment in which the wealth of the agent i falls below agent i's minimum expenditure function at equilibrium price system (Sen, 1981). An agent can be ruined, or fail to survive, in a particular state of environment for two reasons: a meager endowment in this state (a direct effect on the individual) and/or and "unfavorable" equilibrium price system (an indirect terms of trade effect involving the preferences and the endowments of all agents). I compute the asymptotic probability of survival in an economy with two goods and Cobb-Douglas preferences, under the assumption of dependence among the agents in the form of dependency neighborhoods. In the second essay (with Mukul Majumdar), to explore the connection between survival and extrinsic uncertainty we study a model of overlapping generations economy and construct an example of a two-period OLG economy with extrinsic uncertainty (two states of environment mapped into price system), in which an agent may be ruined in one state of nature and survive in the other state, even when the fundamentals (endowments and preferences) of the economy are not affected by uncertainty. Self-fulfilling beliefs of the agents based on "sunspots" may generate an adverse terms of trade, i.e. may lead to an equilibrium price system at which the consumption of old agents is below the minim subsistence level. When survival of all agents is feasible, i.e. the aggregate amount of resources of the economy exceeds total consumption necessary for the survival of all agents, the government intervention, in the form of redistribution, is desirable. We consider the case in which all agents survive in the deterministic equilibrium, and old agents are ruined in one of the sunspot equilibria. We show that in this case the government can implement a policy of lump sum taxes and transfers that fixes consumption at the deterministic equilibrium level, without affecting market prices, and, therefore, ensures survival of all agents in all equilibria. To explore the role of markets for securities in the problem of survival with uncertainty in endowments we consider a two-period economy, with complete markets for Arrow-type securities in the first period and spot markets for commodities in the second period. Agents can insure against the uncertainty in endowments in the second period by trading securities in the first period. We show that trade in securities can, in fact, worsen survival prospects of the agents. In the third essay I consider a model of a pure exchange economy with complete specialization in endowments and asymmetric preferences (similar to Desai, 1989). An agent is ruined, or fails to survive, with positive probability if his consumption of a certain good (essential good, or "food") falls below some minimum subsistence level. I assume that the probability of survival of agent i is a function of his consumption of the essential good: when i's consumption of the essential good is at or above the minimum subsistence level, his probability of survival is equal to one, and this probability decreases monotonically, as i's consumption of the essential good decreases from the minimum subsistence level to zero. I define the objective of an agent as the following: first, an agent maximizes his probability of survival; second, if the agent survives with probability one, he maximizes his utility of consumption. When there is a complete specialization in the endowments, the agents who have to obtain the essential good through trade (non-food producers) are, in general, more vulnerable to the ruin than the agents endowed with the essential good (food producers). Centralized redistribution may reduce the probability of ruin of non-food producers. In a model of dynamic economy with two goods and two types of agents with the preferences described above I consider a government policy of procurement and subsidized public sales. I show (in line with Balakrishnan and Ramaswami, 1995) that this policy may not be sustainable, if the beliefs of the food producers regarding the amount of future public sales are correlated with the current volume of the government stocks. In the fourth chapter of my dissertation (with Salvador Ortigueira) we consider a general equilibrium model of endogenous business cycles with search in the labor market. An infinitely lived representative household maximizes its expected life-time utility. A large number of competitive firms with constant-returns-to-scale production function maximize the expected present value of their stream of profits. There are frictions in the labor market and, therefore, the market for labor does not clear. In equilibrium the amount of labor is determined by the matching function and depends on the level of the workers' and firms' costly search efforts. The search efforts of the workers are modeled by time and intensity of search, and the search efforts of the firms - by number of vacancies. The equilibrium wage is determined by Nash bargaining, with exogenously given bargaining power of the parties. Depending on the values of the parameters in the model, the steady-state equilibrium can be saddle-type stable or sink-type stable. In the latter case the equilibrium path is indeterminate, and there is a room for sunspot equilibria. In the sunspot equilibria the beliefs of the agents regarding, for example, the tightness of the labor market tomorrow, become self-fulfilling. This extrinsic uncertainty generates volatility in the time series of macroeconomic variables. The model is calibrated to the U.S. post-war quarterly data. In a robust region of the parameter values the steady-state equilibrium is a sink. Relative volatilities and cross-correlation of simulated time series for consumption, output, investment, working hours and unemployment are close to the ones observed in U.S. data. The model also yields significant autocorrelation in the output growth and a hump-shape impulse response function of output, - facts that the traditional business cycle models cannot explain. In the fifth chapter of my dissertation (with Timothy Vogelsang) we derive a new asymptotic approximation for sampling distribution of non-parametric spectral density estimators. Spectral analysis is used, for example, in macroeconomics to detect systematic patterns in the time series of aggregate economic variables (seasonality, business cycles). The key feature of the new asymptotic approximation is that the autocovariance truncation lag is modeled as a fixed proportion of the sample size, whereas in the traditional approach (normal approximation, Tukey's chi-squared approximation) it is assumed to grow more slowly than the sample size. It is shown that under this new assumption for truncation lag the distribution of spectral density estimators can be approximated by a function of independent Wiener processes. This result generalizes earlier work by Neave (1970) who only considered approximations for the sampling variance of the spectral density estimator. Finite sample simulations indicate that the new asymptotics is often more accurate than traditional asymptotic approximations, and it performs uniformly better than normal and chi-squared approximations for large values of bandwidth.},

When prices are private information, a dynamic with a globally stable stationary state obtains in economies that are unstable in the tatonnement process. We provide an agent-based model of a multi-sector Walrasian economy with production and exchange, in which prices are private information. This economy is dynamically well behaved.},

Explains the patchy performance of Keynesian policies in recent years and examines the impact of the birth and death of firms on the supply side of the economy. Provides detailed analyses of both the U.S. and U.K. economies, and examines the various theories of unemployment. Suggests a method of analysis that enables the modeling of the equilibrium properties of dynamic, non-market-clearing economies characterized by oligopolistic markets. Presents an agent-based, applied general disequilibrium model of a hypothetical economy with individual consumers, workers, and firms based in different regions of the country, and analyzes several simulations of this model under a number of alternative scenarios.

Although simple, the model can reproduce a lot of the stylized facts of business cycles. The author argues that agent-based modeling is an adequate response to the recently expressed criticism of macroeconomic methodology because it allows for aggregate behavior that is more than simply a replication of microeconomic optimization decisions in equilibrium. At the same time, it allows for absolutely consistent microfoundations, including the structure and properties of markets. Most importantly, it does not depend on equilibrium assumptions or fictitious auctioneers and does therefore not rule out coordination failures, instability, and crisis by definition. A situation that is very close to a general equilibrium can instead be shown to result endogenously from non-rational micro interaction.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a synthesis of ecological economics with econophysics and other complexity approaches to economics. Arguably, the resulting “ecological econophysics” will be scientifically sounder than mainstream economics and much better suited to addressing a major challenge of our times: the development of democratically-based policies to reduce economic throughput to an environmentally sustainable level without triggering economic crises and without excluding part of the world’s population, i.e., to implement degrowth. Degrowth will need major structural changes, which leads us to question whether there are limits to the malleability of the economic system’s architecture. A fundamental limit will be encountered if, as suggested by the physics of complexity, long-lasting complex systems always occur midway between an ordered and a disordered state. There is much evidence that this hypothesis holds and that the current economic system satisfies this condition. However, this does not mean that the problems posed by this system should be unavoidable. Ecological econophysics gives clues to identifying alternative economic systems that would also function between order and chaos, but which would have radically different implications for environmental sustainability and social justice.},

	abstract = {Research which explores unchartered waters has a high potential for major impact but also carries a higher uncertainty of having impact. Such explorative research is often described as taking a novel approach. This study examines the complex relationship between pursuing a novel approach and impact. Viewing scientific research as a combinatorial process, we measure novelty in science by examining whether a published paper makes first time ever combinations of referenced journals, taking into account the difficulty of making such combinations. We apply this newly developed measure of novelty to all Web of Science research articles published in 2001 across all scientific disciplines. We find that highly novel papers, defined to be those that make more (distant) new combinations, deliver high gains to science: they are more likely to be a top 1\% highly cited paper in the long run, to inspire follow on highly cited research, and to be cited in a broader set of disciplines. At the same time, novel research is also more risky, reflected by a higher variance in its citation performance. In addition, we find that novel research is significantly more highly cited in “foreign” fields but not in its “home” field. We also find strong evidence of delayed recognition of novel papers and that novel papers are less likely to be top cited when using a short time window. Finally, novel papers typically are published in journals with a lower than expected Impact Factor. These findings suggest that science policy, in particular funding decisions which rely on traditional bibliometric indicators based on short-term direct citation counts and Journal Impact Factors, may be biased against “high risk/high gain” novel research. The findings also caution against a mono-disciplinary approach in peer review to assess the true value of novel research.},

Contributing factors that lead to extreme values include high geopolitical concentration of primary production, lack of available suitable substitutes, and political instability. The results show that the limitations for many metals important in emerging electronics (e.g., gallium and selenium) are largely those related to supply risk; those of platinum group metals, gold, and mercury, to environmental implications; and steel alloying elements (e.g., chromium and niobium) as well as elements used in high-temperature alloys (e.g., tungsten and molybdenum), to vulnerability to supply restriction. The metals of most concern tend to be those available largely or entirely as byproducts, used in small quantities for highly specialized applications, and possessing no effective substitutes.},

	abstract = {While strategic studies on natural resources usually focus on the criticality of certain single materials, our paper starts from the inter-linkages between and among resources (called “the resource nexus”). It examines the impact any food and water stress may have on extraction activities in fragile states and regions. According to our approach, conflicts are likely to increase and may escalate in a number of countries, many of which are of relevance for the global supply of strategic materials. Future criticality for European and other industries, thus, is more likely to result from particular regions surpassing their adaptive capacities, and not mainly from limited availability or bottlenecks in the supply chain. The paper first develops a heuristic model of drivers for stress in resource-rich regions. Applying this approach, our paper then develops a global three-layered map along the dimensions of (i) future regional food and water stress, (ii) fragility of countries, and (iii) resource-rich countries with relevant reserves of strategic materials. As a result our paper tentatively identifies 15 countries at high risk and some 30 other countries being at relevant risk of causing resource supply disruptions. The conclusions underline the need to analyse those global inter-linkages and institutional mechanisms for strategic futures studies at a regional scale. As this may go beyond the capacities of actors on commodity markets, our paper also draws conclusions towards the establishment of an international data hub on the global resource nexus and for futures research. The paper points to some of the long-term implications of these issues.},

	abstract = {It is indisputable that modern life is enabled by the use of materials in its technologies. Those technologies do many things very well, largely because each material is used for purposes to which it is exquisitely fitted. The result over time has been a steady increase in product performance. We show that this materials complexity has markedly increased in the past half-century and that elemental life cycle analyses characterize rates of recycling and loss. A further concern is that of possible scarcity of some of the elements as their use increases. Should materials availability constraints occur, the use of substitute materials comes to mind. We studied substitution potential by generating a comprehensive summary of potential substitutes for 62 different metals in all their major uses and of the performance of the substitutes in those applications. As we show herein, for a dozen different metals, the potential substitutes for their major uses are either inadequate or appear not to exist at all. Further, for not 1 of the 62 metals are exemplary substitutes available for all major uses. This situation largely decouples materials substitution from price, thereby forcing material design changes to be primarily transformative rather than incremental. As wealth and population increase worldwide in the next few decades, scientists will be increasingly challenged to maintain and improve product utility by designing new and better materials, but doing so under potential constraints in resource availability.},

	abstract = {In-use stock of a product is the amount of the product in active use. In-use product stocks provide various functions or services on which we rely in our daily work and lives, and the concept of in-use product stock for industrial ecologists is similar to the concept of net manufactured capital stock for economists. This study estimates historical physical in-use stocks of 91 products and 9 product groups and uses monetary data on net capital stocks of 56 products to either approximate or compare with in-use stocks of the corresponding products in the United States. Findings include the following: (i) The development of new products and the buildup of their in-use stocks result in the increase in variety of in-use product stocks and of manufactured capital; (ii) substitution among products providing similar or identical functions reflects the improvement in quality of in-use product stocks and of manufactured capital; and (iii) the historical evolution of stocks of the 156 products or product groups in absolute, per capita, or per-household terms shows that stocks of most products have reached or are approaching an upper limit. Because the buildup, renewal, renovation, maintenance, and operation of in-use product stocks drive the anthropogenic cycles of materials that are used to produce products and that originate from natural capital, the determination of in-use product stocks together with modeling of anthropogenic material cycles provides an analytic perspective on the material linkage between manufactured capital and natural capital.},

	abstract = {Research which explores unchartered waters has a high potential for major impact but also carries a higher uncertainty of having impact. Such explorative research is often described as taking a novel approach. This study examines the complex relationship between pursuing a novel approach and impact. Viewing scientific research as a combinatorial process, we measure novelty in science by examining whether a published paper makes first time ever combinations of referenced journals, taking into account the difficulty of making such combinations. We apply this newly developed measure of novelty to all Web of Science research articles published in 2001 across all scientific disciplines. We find that highly novel papers, defined to be those that make more (distant) new combinations, deliver high gains to science: they are more likely to be a top 1\% highly cited paper in the long run, to inspire follow on highly cited research, and to be cited in a broader set of disciplines. At the same time, novel research is also more risky, reflected by a higher variance in its citation performance. In addition, we find that novel research is significantly more highly cited in “foreign” fields but not in its “home” field. We also find strong evidence of delayed recognition of novel papers and that novel papers are less likely to be top cited when using a short time window. Finally, novel papers typically are published in journals with a lower than expected Impact Factor. These findings suggest that science policy, in particular funding decisions which rely on traditional bibliometric indicators based on short-term direct citation counts and Journal Impact Factors, may be biased against “high risk/high gain” novel research. The findings also caution against a mono-disciplinary approach in peer review to assess the true value of novel research.},

	abstract = {Complexity science—made possible by modern analytical and computational advances—is changing the way we think about social systems and social theory. Unfortunately, economists’ policy models have not kept up and are stuck in either a market fundamentalist or government control narrative. While these standard narratives are useful in some cases, they are damaging in others, directing thinking away from creative, innovative policy solutions. Complexity and the Art of Public Policy outlines a new, more flexible policy narrative, which envisions society as a complex evolving system that is uncontrollable but can be influenced. David Colander and Roland Kupers describe how economists and society became locked into the current policy framework, and lay out fresh alternatives for framing policy questions. Offering original solutions to stubborn problems, the complexity narrative builds on broader philosophical traditions, such as those in the work of John Stuart Mill, to suggest initiatives that the authors call “activist laissez-faire” policies. Colander and Kupers develop innovative bottom-up solutions that, through new institutional structures such as for-benefit corporations, channel individuals’ social instincts into solving societal problems, making profits a tool for change rather than a goal. They argue that a central role for government in this complexity framework is to foster an ecostructure within which diverse forms of social entrepreneurship can emerge and blossom.},

After two centuries of studying equilibria — patterns of consistency that call for no further behavioral adjustments — economists are beginning to study the unfolding of patterns in the economy. That is, we are starting to study the economy out of equilibrium. This way of doing economics calls for an algorithmic approach. When viewed out of equilibrium, the economy reveals itself not as deterministic, predictable and mechanistic; but as process-dependent, organic and evolving.},

	abstract = {A new view of the economy as an evolving, complex system has been pioneered at the Santa Fe Institute over the last ten years, This volume is a collection of articles that shape and define this view—a view of the economy as emerging from the interactions of individual agents whose behavior constantly evolves, whose strategies and actions are always adapting.The traditional framework in economics portrays activity within an equilibrium steady state. The interacting agents in the economy are typically homogenous, solve well-defined problems using perfect rationality, and act within given legal and social structures. The complexity approach, by contrast, sees economic activity as continually changing—continually in process. The interacting agents are typically heterogeneous, they must cognitively interpret the problems they face, and together they create the structures—markets, legal and social institutions, price patters, expectations—to which they individually react. Such structures may never settle down. Agents may forever adapt and explore and evolve their behaviors within structures that continually emerge and change and disappear—structures these behaviors co-create. This complexity approach does not replace the equilibrium one—it complements it.The papers here collected originated at a recent conference at the Santa Fe Institute, which was called to follow up the well-known 1987 SFI conference organized by Philip Anderson, Kenneth Arrow, and David Pines. They survey the new study of complexity and the economy. They apply this approach to real economic problems and they show the extent to which the initial vision of the 1987 conference has come to fruition.},

Modern innovations such as personal                 computers, laser surgery, jet airplanes, and satellite communication have made us                 rich and transformed the way we live and work. But technological change has also                 brought with it a variety of social problems. It has been blamed at various times                 for increasing wage and income inequality, unemployment, obsolescence of physical                 and human capital, environmental deterioration, and prolonged                 recessions.To understand the contradictory effects of                 technological change on the economy, one must delve into structural details of the                 innovation process to analyze how laws, institutions, customs, and regulations                 affect peoples' incentive and ability to create new knowledge and profit from it. To                 show how this can be done, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt make use of Schumpeter's                 concept of creative destruction, the competitive process whereby entrepreneurs                 constantly seek new ideas that will render their rivals' ideas                 obsolete.Whereas other books on endogenous growth stress a                 particular aspect, such as trade or convergence, this book provides a comprehensive                 survey of the theoretical and empirical debates raised by modern growth theory. It                 develops a powerful engine of analysis that sheds light not only on economic growth                 per se, but on the many other phenomena that interact with growth, such as                 inequality, unemployment, capital accumulation, education, competition, natural                 resources, international trade, economic cycles, and public policy.},

The DSGE methodology attempts to explain aggregate economic phenomena, such as economic growth, business cycles, and the effects of monetary and fiscal policy, on the basis of macroeconomic models derived from microeconomic principles.
While traditional macroeconometric forecasting models are vulnerable to the Lucas critique—that claims that the effects of an economic policy cannot be predicted using historical data from a period when that policy was not in place—microfounded models should not be, at least in theory. Further, since the microfoundations are based on the preferences of the decision-makers in the model, DSGE models feature a natural benchmark for evaluating the welfare effects of policy changes (for discussion of both points, see Woodford, 2003, pp. 11–12 and Tovar, 2008, pp. 15–16).},

	abstract = {This paper examines the conditional convergence of carbon dioxide emissions in 11 Asian countries over the period of 1972-2009. We allow for spatial dependence in emissions across countries to consider the possibility that country's emissions are affected by emissions in neighboring countries. We utilize the spatial Durbin model (SDM) and spatial lag model (SAM) estimation for the Green Solow model and also employ distribution dynamics using the nonparametric method with three different emission samples: per capita , relative , and intensities. We found that emissions are significantly influenced by the emissions of neighboring countries. These test results on SDM for per capita and SAM for intensities do not support the convergence hypothesis. However, when we control for both the individual and time-period fixed effects, for relative and intensities, SAM supports the convergence hypothesis. With the distributional dynamics approach adapting spatial-filtering and HP-filtering techniques before proceeding with the estimate of the stochastic kernel, we find that per capita and intensities indicate a strong tendency toward convergence in Asian countries over the entire period, yet relative shows dynamics with a switch toward divergence. In conclusion, the emission intensities among Asian countries strongly support the convergence to the long-run steady state of emissions as Asian economies develop. However, relative emissions in Asian countries do not converge with the long-run steady-state level of developed countries as sustainable growth paths are predicted from the theoretical Solow model.},

	abstract = {Sustainability and optimality are the two main issues discussed in environmental economics and economic growth theory. This paper studies economic growth in the presence of two environmental externalities. The first one is local and gives account of the marginal damage from the emissions flow. The second one is aggregate, or global, and relates to the extreme damage which may happen if the accumulated stock of pollutants is on the threshold of a worldwide catastrophe. In this context, the decentralized equilibrium is inefficient and economic growth unsustainable. However, we find and completely characterize the socially optimal equilibrium, which shows that sustained growth is feasible along the balanced path. Efficiency alone is not sufficient for sustainability, but Pareto optimality is necessary to produce sustainable outcomes. According to our results, the sustainability of the optimal sustained long-run growth depends on environmental constraints, production and abatement technologies, individual preferences, and population dynamics. This means that government has a clear incentive for intervention by means of direct and indirect policies. These ones cover the usual Pigouvian taxes and subsidies, the setting of emission standards, and the public provision of abatement. Moreover, the government can promote eco-efficiency in the use of materials, implement information campaigns that influence social preferences for environmental conservation, or even put into action population controls and other measures that encourage the demographic transition.

However, the within-country dimension matters for both the implementation and the policy formation of climate policies. As a preliminary step towards a better understanding of within-country inequalities, this paper measures their extent for the two major greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4, over the 1970-2008 period. Using Theil-index decompositions, we show that within-country inequalities account for the bulk of global inequality, and tend to increase over the sample period, in contrast with diminishing between-country inequalities. Including differences across sectors reveals that between-sector inequalities matter more than between-country inequalities, and between-sector inequalities become the dominant source of global inequality at the end of the sample period in the CO2 case. Finally, estimated social tensions arising from the disconnection between emissions and future damages turn out to be increasing as soon as within-country disparities are taken into account. These orders of magnitude should be kept in mind while discussing the efficiency and fairness of alternative paths in combating global warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.06.054},
	abstract = {As China's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, China's environmental pollution has become increasingly significant. Among all the traditional pollutants, sulfur dioxide has been monitored by the Chinese government since the 1990s. In this study, China's city-level panel data between 2002 and 2012 are utilized to investigate the existence of convergence in per capita sulfur dioxide emissions across Chinese cities. The conventional estimation methods for beta-convergence suffer from an endogeneity problem and therefore produce biased results. To address the endogeneity problem and allow for dynamics, dynamic panel data estimators are utilized, and the static estimation results are conducted as a robustness check. In addition, the influential factors for convergence are examined. The empirical results indicate that, in the chosen sample period, there were absolute and conditional convergences in per capita sulfur dioxide emissions across cities within the whole nation as well as in the eastern, western and central regions of China. Because per capita Gross Domestic Product and the ratio of secondary industry to Gross Domestic Product are both positively related with per capita sulfur dioxide emissions, higher income per capita and greater importance of the secondary industry would cause the convergence speed to be lower. Therefore, the most straightforward policy implication for the empirical results is that the policies for controlling sulfur dioxide emissions should be regionally differentiated: for cities with high sulfur dioxide emissions per capita, the regulation could be tight, as the emissions would decrease faster because convergence exists; however, for cities with low sulfur dioxide emissions per capita, the target for reducing emissions should not be excessively aggressive.

We firstly consider a Solow-type framework in which economic and environmental policies are completely exogenous, and then we move to a Ramsey-type context in which they are endogenously determined. We analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of the model economy through numerical simulations, and we consider two different specifications Of the production function (a globally concave and a convex-concave technology) in order to stress the role that eventual poverty traps might play on both economic and environmental outcomes. We show that in the convex-concave technology framework, whenever rich regions are substantially rich diffusion can help poor regions to escape their poverty traps; if however they are not rich enough diffusion might condemn also rich regions to collapse. However, even if rich regions are particularly rich whenever the pollution externality is strong, the whole spatial economy might be doomed to collapse. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our analysis also shows that, contrary to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), environmental quality cannot be maintained or improved via economic growth. Instead, the improvement in environmental quality, as measured by a reduction in pollution, can only be achieved by an increase in the environmental self-renewal rate or the recycling ratio.

(2) Steady state consumption rises in most of our experiments. (3) Welfare can rise by as much as 0.6\% in consumption equivalent terms.

Our study supports the assumption of conditional convergence among all EU Member States. It should take around 10 years for the EU-15 countries to stabilize their per capita emissions. This result holds if we include the new Member States in the sample. We also find that the emission growth/GDP relation is strictly negative, indicating that EU-15 countries switched to a less carbon intensive economy starting from the early 1990s. This result remains robust when the new Member States are included. We therefore argue that the decline in EU carbon emissions is a long-term trend and not a result of the economic crisis. We then discuss the effectiveness of climate and energy policies and the EU burden-sharing agreement. Some countries like Germany, Great Britain and France can meet their carbon targets without adopting more aggressive climate and energy policies by 2020. Other EU-15 Member States can reduce their domestic emissions beyond their targets if they adopt energy-efficient technologies. Most of the new Member States emit much less than their domestic targets even when per capita income and oil price increase.},

Our approach differs from previous work on carbon convergence in that it employs a theoretical framework to construct a CO2 performance index, which explicitly takes into account that industrial firms produce good as well as bad outputs. This index is then used as the dependent variable in a growth-type regression equation. We employ a data set covering 14 industrial sectors over the time period 1990-2008. The results suggest the presence of conditional beta-convergence in CO2 performance among the industrial sectors in Sweden. Moreover, the speed of convergence varies significantly in the sense that the higher the capital intensity is, the lower is the convergence rate to the different steady states. This is likely to reflect the importance of - and in part the costs associated with - capital turnover to achieve a transition towards lower CO2 emission paths. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The literature to date has ignored the fact, and a fortiori the consequences, that powers of integrated processes are themselves not integrated processes. The paper explains why standard methods should not be applied and discusses some recently proposed viable estimation and testing approaches for cointegrating polynomial regressions. The application to CO2 and SO2 emissions data shows that using appropriate methods leads to strongly reduced evidence for a cointegrating EKC compared to typical but conceptually not sound findings.

Our methodology extends the World Bank's Adjusted Net Saving (ANS) indicator to include the cost of population growth, the benefit of technical progress, and a much higher, precautionary cost of current CO2 emissions. Future warming damage is so highly unknowable that valuing emissions directly is rather arbitrary, so we use a novel, inductive approach: we modify damage and climate parameters in the deterministic DICE climate-economy model so it becomes economically optimal to control emissions in a way likely to limit warming to an agreed target, here 2 degrees C. If future emissions are optimally controlled, our ANS then suggests that current global well-being is sustainable. But if emissions remain uncontrolled, our base-case ANS is negative now and our corresponding, modified DICE model has an unsustained development path, with well-being peaking in 2065. Current ANS on an uncontrolled path may thus be a useful heuristic indicator of future unsustainability. Our inductive method might allow ANS to include other very hard-to-value, environmental threats to global sustainability, like biodiversity loss and nitrogen pollution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We statistically analyze the relationship between both industrial and non-industrial greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth and other potential drivers for 129 countries over the period from 1971 to 2010.

The time effect is negative for both sources of emissions, though this effect is larger for non-industrial emissions. There is also convergence in emissions intensity for both types of emissions but given these other effects there is no evidence for an environmental Kuznets curve. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, paper aims at investigating the validity of the EKC hypothesis employing the dependent variable of CO2 emissions and regressors of GDP, quadratic GDP and renewable energy consumption. This paper, hence, analyzes this revisited EKC hypothesis to observe if (i) there exists an inverted-U shaped relationship between environmental quality (in terms of CO2 emissions), per capita income and per capita income squared and (ii) there exists a negative causality from renewables to CO2 emissions within EKC model. Paper employs a panel data set of 17 OECD countries over the period 1977-2010 and launches panel FMOLS and panel DOLS estimations. The findings support the EKC hypothesis for the panel and indicate that GDP per capita and GDP per capita squared have the impacts on CO2 emissions positively and negatively, respectively, and that renewable energy consumption yields negative impact on CO2 emissions. Another remark of this paper is that the validity of EKC does not depend on income level of individual countries of panel in which EKC hypothesis holds. Eventually, paper argues that if countries carry out (i) policies, i.e., for fair and easy access to the electricity from renewable sources and (ii) policies to increase renewables supply through i.e. improved renewable energy technologies, they will be able to contribute to combating global warming problem as they increase their GDP's.

To verify the capability of this framework to address China's economy, a key prediction of the GSM - the convergence in per capita CO2 emissions across Chinese provinces - is empirically verified. By assigning reasonable values to the GSM's key parameters, the trajectories of total CO2 emissions are projected for the three regions of China and the whole country.

However, pollution load indicators seem insufficient to represent environmental quality comprehensively. Therefore, the empirical study of EKC for environmental quality, which confirms a U-shaped relationship has been conducted in Gansu province, China. What is more, time series econometric methodologies were used to take environmental quality as endogenous variable, and Bayesian methods were employed to deal with the trouble of overfitting problem. Based on the empirical data of Gansu province from 1980 to 2012, the cointegration equation derived from Bayesian VAR with Minnesota prior shows the optimal estimation. And the results have shown that the EKC for environmental quality in Gansu province was verified. It proved that it is possible for low-income economy to improve environmental quality rather than at the cost of being poorer. Technical effect and environmental regulations may play important roles for the decline of the curve.

Based upon empirical evidence, we develop an overlapping generations model with environmental quality and endogenous environmental culture. Environmental culture may be costlessly transmitted intergenerationally, or via costly education. The model predicts that for low wealth levels, society is unable to free resources for environmental culture. In this case, society will only invest in environmental maintenance if environmental quality is sufficiently low. Once society has reached a certain level of economic development, then it may optimally invest a part of its wealth in developing an environmental culture. Environmental culture has not only a positive impact on environmental quality through lower levels of consumption, but it also improves the environment through maintenance expenditure for wealth-environment combinations at which, in a restricted model without environmental culture, no maintenance would be undertaken. Environmental culture leads to a society with a higher indirect utility at steady state in comparison to the restricted model. Our model leads us to the conclusion that, for societies trapped in a situation with low environmental quality, investments in culture may induce positive feedback loops, where more culture raises environmental quality which in turn raises environmental culture. We also discuss how environmental culture may lead to an Environmental Kuznets Curve. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

If residents engage in environmental protection activities, it then may be possible for environmentally based tourism economies to reach a smooth development process. The author shows that the (sustainable) balanced growth path is the only viable equilibrium, and along such a path consumption grows while environmental quality rises. Tourists' preferences crucially affect the long-run outcome, since economic and environmental growth rates increase with the green preference and decrease with the grey preference and crowding aversion parameters.

	abstract = {Ongoing success throughout regional development is contingent on maintaining the function, quality and harmony progress in society, economy and environment domains, so exploring the interaction and relation among them should be considerable significant. The model by coupling principal component analysis and vector autoregressive, which relate the aggregated values and dynamic analysis among factors, is proposed to achieve the qualitative and quantitative analysis of interaction and relation among society, economy and environment subsystem, providing a framework to conceptualize the influences among their changes and simulate the future scenarios in the Bohai Rim region. The impulse response analysis and variance decomposition of vector autoregressive method, in particular, permit dynamic interaction between every two systems and display clear decomposition of contribution for each change, respectively. This study results show that: there is a virtuous circle of promotion between economic growth and social progress no matter which is regarded as the endogenous variable during the study period, and yet the negative effect to environmental changes had been produced; what the improvement of social and environmental situation need most might be advancing its own progress; it is also reflected that the entire complicated system walk on the path of unsustainable development due to the evident disequilibrium of three subsystems; and the scenario analysis results obviously tell that in order to attain coordinated development, the annual growth rate of 12\% to 16\% of overall environmental level should be anticipated along with 8\% of social and economic level improve. The study guide future possibilities for relatively more harmonious interconnections among social, economic and the environmental development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

By relying on recent advances on Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and adopting interaction models, we handle simultaneously three main econometric issues, named here as functional form bias, heterogeneity bias and omitted time related factors bias, which have been proved to be relevant but have been addressed separately in previous papers. The model incorporates nonlinear effects, eventually heterogeneous across countries, for both income and time. We also handle serial correlation by using autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes. We find that country-specific time related factors weight more than income in driving the northern EU Environmental Kuznets. Overall, the countries differ more on their carbon-time relation than on the carbon-income relation which is in almost all cases monotonic positive. Once serial correlation and (heterogeneous) time effects have been accounted for, only three Scandinavian countries - Denmark, Finland and Sweden - present some threshold effect on the CO2-development relation.},

Four regimes can occur, depending on the initial social cost of oil being larger or smaller than that of renewables and depending on the initial oil stock being large or small. We also offer some policy simulations for the first and second regime, which illustrate that with a lower discount rate more oil is left in situ and renewables are phased in more quickly. We identify the conditions under which the optimal carbon tax rises or decreases. Subsidizing renewables (without a carbon tax) induces more oil to be left in situ and a quicker phasing in of renewables, but oil is depleted more rapidly initially.

The semiparametric models confirm that there is heterogeneity across countries in coefficient estimates; however, such heterogeneity does not appear to be substantial enough to qualitatively influence the estimates derived from the parametric models. Hence, I find that (i) the green Solow model is a robust framework for analyzing carbon emissions convergence and (ii) carbon emissions are converging across a large sample of countries.

We argue that countries' ratification of the statutes governing the International Criminal Court is a valid instrument for ratification of Kyoto commitments. In our panel fixed effects estimations, the instrument easily passes weak identification and overidentification tests. It can be plausibly excluded from our second-stage equations and does not cause CO2 emissions. Our estimates suggest that Kyoto ratification has a quantitatively large (about 10 percent) and robust, though only moderately statistically significant, negative effect on CO2 emissions. We also show that higher fuel prices and a different energy mix in Kyoto countries support this result.},

The results of the analysis provide evidence that world energy resource markets are acting as a coordinating mechanism for emission fluctuations in most cases. The results also suggest that until recently the dominant emission co-fluctuation pattern for developed countries differs from the dominant emission co-fluctuation pattern for developing countries. The common fluctuation pattern found in the 1984-2000 time period suggests that an offsetting mechanism does exist and will help contain global per capita emissions into the future. The strong degree that emissions are linked between countries and energy markets acting as an offsetting mechanism suggests that to be successful a global agreement to address climate change must require emission reductions by all major emitters, not just the developed countries.

We do find that in coherence with their policy and economic commitment to carbon reductions and environmental market-based instruments implementation, bell shapes are present only for northern EU, which leads the group of advanced countries. The other two lag behind. We show for the first time that CKC shapes are present if we net out Europe of the southern and less developed countries. This is coherent with the Kuznets paradigm. The negative side of the tale is that they characterize a bunch of few countries. Other advanced countries lag behind and are far from reaching a CKC dynamics. Heterogeneous and Bayesian estimators clearly show this, with the EU presenting turning points closely around \$13?000 per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Heterogeneous panel estimates also show that for lagging countries presumed bell shapes turn into linear relationships. The stability of outcomes across models is stronger when we compare heterogeneous rather than homogeneous models.

First, evidence does not support theoretical models predicting the existence of a poverty-environment trap. Specifically, in the long-run two main groups of countries will emerge: poor versus polluting countries. Second, the typical development path leads initially to high emission levels and, subsequently, to high income. Third, the convergence process towards the stationary distribution is very slow.

It shows how this classical, human-centred tradition, stretching from Adam Smith onward, gives us a much better understanding of economic events - and what to do about them - than the mechanistic, mathematical models of too many economists and planners today.'- Eamonn Butler, The Adam Smith Institute, UK'David Simpson writes about key economic issues with admirable lucidity. He draws deeply on experience as well as on his knowledge of economic theory.'- Asa BriggsDavid Simpson skilfully argues that a market economy can be best understood as a human complex system, a perspective that represents a continuation of the classical tradition in economic thought. In the classical tradition, growth rather than allocative efficiency is the principal object of enquiry, economic phenomena are recognised to be elements of processes rather than structures, and change is evolutionary.The book shows the common principles that connect the early classical school, the Austrian school and complexity theory in a single line of thought. It goes on to show how these principles can be applied to explain the characteristic features of a market economy - namely incessant change, growth, the business cycle and the market process itself - and argues that static equilibrium theory, whether neoclassical or neo-Keynesian, cannot satisfactorily account for these phenomena.This fascinating book will provide a stimulating read for academics, postgraduate students and all those with an interest in economic theory and economic policy.Contents: Preface 1.

	title = {The {Evolution} of {Economic} and {Innovation} {Systems}},
	abstract = {This book is at the cutting edge of the ongoing ‘neo-Schumpeterian’ research program that investigates how economic growth and its fluctuation can be understood as the outcome of a historical process of economic evolution. Much of modern evolutionary economics has relied upon biological analogy, especially about natural selection. Although this is valid and useful, evolutionary economists have, increasingly, begun to build their analytical representations of economic evolution on understandings derived from complex systems science. In this book, the fact that economic systems are, necessarily, complex adaptive systems is explored, both theoretically and empirically, in a range of contexts. Throughout, there is a primary focus upon the interconnected processes of innovation and entrepreneurship, which are the ultimate sources of all economic growth. Twenty two chapters are provided by renowned experts in the related fields of evolutionary economics and the economics of innovation.},

"Schelling here offers an early analysis of 'tipping' in social situations involving a large number of individuals."―official citation for the 2005 Nobel PrizeMicromotives and Macrobehavior was originally published over twenty-five years ago, yet the stories it tells feel just as fresh today. And the subject of these stories―how small and seemingly meaningless decisions and actions by individuals often lead to significant unintended consequences for a large group―is more important than ever. In one famous example, Thomas C. Schelling shows that a slight-but-not-malicious preference to have neighbors of the same race eventually leads to completely segregated populations. The updated edition of this landmark book contains a new preface and the author's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.},

This index is empirically applied in a tentative answer to the following questions: Should we expect to find a natural shift towards greater complexity as an economy grows and develops? Is a larger economy necessarily more complex than a smaller one? The interindustry tables of several OECD countries provide the material support for making international and historical comparisons of economic complexity as a level of interrelatedness.},
